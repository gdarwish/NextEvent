### Events

Entering a search will provide a list of events from the database. The search bar will only look for titles that contain the search the user entered. Tapping on one of the Events will take you to an screen that shows off the event's details.

### Event Details

The event details screen holds all the details about the event that you need. 

Tapping on the save icon saves the event to your saved events, so you can view it later. Clicking on More Info will take you to the website for the app. The Directions Icon will provide you will the exact location for the event, and the Share Icon will provide you with several options to share the event with your friends or family.

Finally, selecting the Add Event button will add the event to the in-app calendar, so you can plan out your event schedule.

### Calendar

The Calendar screen affords you a view of the events you have added to it. The day with the outlined blue square around it is the current day, and the day with the blue circle is the day you currently have selected. Just below the calendar you can see all the events you have on the day you have selected. If you wish to remove an event from that day, just tap on the trash icon.
